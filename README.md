## Strategic Summary
I am a highly motivated first-year Cybersecurity engineering student with a robust foundation in mathematics, algorithm design, and programming (Python, Java). I bring specialized expertise in cryptography and information security, demonstrated through independent research on RSA cryptosystems, lattice-based attacks, and cryptanalytic vulnerabilities. My analytical approach combines theoretical rigor—applying number theory and algebraic proofs to security problems—with practical implementation skills. I'm passionate about cyber defense and interested in exploring machine learning and automation applications within cybersecurity. I'm continuously expanding my knowledge through hands-on learning courses. I'm eager to contribute my theoretical knowledge, research experience, and technical skills to a challenging cybersecurity internship where I can apply my foundation in algorithm design and information security while developing capabilities in machine learning and automation. My goal is to leverage my analytical mindset and programming skills to help organizations strengthen their security posture against evolving cyber threats.
